## Create an ingress
An ingress allows you to specify mappings from external domains like `hasura.canida.io` to the hasura backend service.
Your cloud provider / ingress addon will respond to the ingress creation by spawning an ingress controller.
Please research how to create an ingress for your specific infrastructure.

## Create a DNS entry
Next create a DNS entry that links your domain to the ingress controller.
Then it should be possible to access the hasura instance via the domain name.
