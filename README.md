# hasura-helm-chart
Kubernetes Helm chart to deploy Hasura and initialize the metadata and migrations from a git repository. 
The Helm charts also contain a questions.yaml file which provides an enhanced user experience when deploying Hasura
via Rancher.

## Basic Installation

To use the helm chart, first add the helm repo:

```
helm repo add hasura https://2start.github.io/hasura-helm-chart/
```


Rancher to install the Helm chart: Please take a look at the [values.yaml](charts/hasura/values.yaml) file to see all the values that you can overwrite. For descriptions of the values you can take a look into [questions.yaml](charts/hasura/questions.yaml). It should be self explaining and describe all the parameters that you are supposed to change.


## Rancher Installation
Add the repo `https://2start.github.io/hasura-helm-chart/` via the GUI.
Launch a new App afterwards. The autogenerated form fields specified in [questions.yaml](charts/hasura/questions.yaml) will guide you through the configuration process.
